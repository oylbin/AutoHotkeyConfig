# AutoHotkeyConfig

I use both Mac and PC at the same time. I want the shortcuts on both OS map to the same key position.

| shortcuts | function |
| --- | --- |
| control + n | move cursor to next line |
| control + p | move cursor to previous line |
| control + a | move cursor to begin of line |
| control + e | move cursor to end of line |
| control + f | move cursor forward |
| control + b | move cursor backward |
| control + k | kill to end of line |
| control + d | delete character after the cursor |
