# AutoHotkeyConfig

I use both Mac and PC at the same time. I want the shortcuts on both OS map to the same key position.


Key position on keyboards:

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| control | option | command |
| control | win | alt |
| | | |



| shortcuts | function |
| --- | --- |
| capslock + n | move cursor to next line |
| capslock + p | move cursor to previous line |
| capslock + a | move cursor to begin of line |
| capslock + e | move cursor to end of line |
| capslock + f | move cursor forward |
| capslock + b | move cursor backward |
| capslock + k | kill to end of line |
| capslock + d | delete character after the cursor |
| capslock + space | alfred on macos / quick assist on windows |
| alt + c | copy |
| alt + x | cut |
| alt + v | paste |
| alt + z | undo |
| alt + a | select all |
| alt + s | save |
| alt + f | search |
| win + alt + c | clipboard history |
| alt + w | close window or tab |
| alt + l | focus on location bar when in browser |
| alt + t | new tab in browser |
